Before running the scripts, these modules must be installed:
pandas
matplotlib
numpy
csv (works without it sometimes)

To install these modules, simply go to terminal (on Mac or Linux) or Command Promt (On Windows) and run:
pip install module_name

Please MAXIMIZE or FULLSCREEN all windows after you run the scripts to get the best format.

Which scripts to run:

barGraph.py
pies2.py
tables3.py

How to run:

Easiest Way to run is to use VSCode: 
1) Install the JUPYTER EXTENTION form the extentions store
2) Run the scripts using the JUPYTER EXTENTION on VSCode


If it doesn't work or you don't want to use VSCode, 
use the following method:

Windows 11:
1) Go to the directory where the scripts are extracted
2) Right click on the directory and open Terminal
3) Run the script using this command: python3 script_name.py


Windows 10:
1) Go to the directory where the script is extracted
2) Copy the path of the directory from the top of the window
3) Open Command Promt or Terminal
4) Type and run: cd FOLDER_PATH
5) Run the scripts using this command: python3 script_name.py


Mac and Linux:
1) Open terminal
2) change directory to where the scripts are located using this command: cd FOLDER_PATH
3) Run the scripts using this command: python3 script_name.py

Note: The scripts can be ran other IDEs but I ran into some issues sometimes. 
VSCode Jupyter or Terminal/Command Promt is more reliable.

Please contact any of our group members (Group 39) if you still cannot run any of the scripts.
