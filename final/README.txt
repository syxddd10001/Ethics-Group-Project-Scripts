Before running the scripts, these modules must be installed:
pandas
matplotlib
matplotlib.pyplot
numpy
csv

To install these modules, simply go to terminal (on Mac or Linux) or Command Promt (On Windows) and run:
pip install module_name

How to run:

Windows 11:
1) Go to the directory where the scripts are extracted
2) Right click on the directory and open Terminal
3) Run the script using this command: python3 script_name.py


Windows 10:
1) Go to the directory where the script is extracted
2) Copy the path of the directory from the top of the window
3) Open Command Promt or Terminal
4) Type and run: cd FOLDER_PATH
5) Run the scripts using this command: python3 script_name.py


Mac and Linux:
1) Open terminal
2) change directory to where the scripts are located using this command: cd FOLDER_PATH
3) Run the scripts using this command: python3 script_name.py

Note: The scripts can be ran using VSCode or other IDEs but I ran into some issues sometimes when running them on VSCode. 
Terminal or Command Promt is more reliable.

Please contact any of our group members (Group 39) if you still cannot run the scripts.
